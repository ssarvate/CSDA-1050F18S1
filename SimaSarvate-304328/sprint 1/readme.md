## CSDA1050

### Sprint 1

This module contains the Exploratory Data Analysis for this project.

### Purpose of this Module

The objectives of this module are:
1. Gather data that is pertinent to the analysis of the research question.
2. Prepare data for exploratory data analysis.
3. Do exploratory data analysis and report findings and insights.

### Pre-requisites for Running Notebook and Code

Python v3

The following packages must be installed for this project:

rtree

gdal

fiona

shapely

geopandas

pysal

missingno

**Note:** Installation should be done in the order listed above as the installation of some packages depend on other packages already being installed.

### Data Used in this Analysis

The following datasets will be initially explored in the EDA:

Red Light Camera Data â€“ List of red light cameras installed in the city of Toronto. This data can be found in The City of Toronto Open Data Catalogue. 

https://portal0.cf.opendata.inter.sandbox-toronto.ca/dataset/red-light-cameras/

Red Light Accident Data - This dataset is a subset of the Killed and Seriously Injured (KSI) dataset from 2008-2018. These events include any serious or fatal collision where red light running played a role in the collision. This dataset is collected by the Toronto Police Service and can be found on The Toronto Police Services Public Safety Data Portal.

Other datasets that may be considered for the EDA after the initial EDA of the above 2 datsets include the following subsets of the KSI (Killed and Seriously Injured) dataset:

Automobile

Speeding

Pedestrians

Cyclist

Aggressive Driving

Passenger

Fatal Collisions

In addition, a shape file along with its associated files are being used in order to plot the camera and accident geopoints on a street map of Toronto. 

All data files can be found in the data folder of this project.

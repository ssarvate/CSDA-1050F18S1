## CSDA1050

### Sprint 2


### Purpose of this Module

The objectives of this module are:

1. Implement refinements to the project that have come to light due to the EDA of sprint 1.
2. Consolidate the analytic and modelling techniques to be used in the project. That is consolidate the methodology.
3. Execute the methodology agreed upon.


### Refinements to the Project

After a review of sprint 1, in particular the visual of the red light camera geopoints alongside the accident geopoints on the map of Toronto as well as the plot of the accident geopoints by themselves, the initial general research question posed in the proposal has evolved into a more specific question as follows:

**Do the 77 red light cameras installed around the City of Toronto reduce the number of red light running accidents in the areas surrounding those intersections?**



### Pre-requisites for Running Notebook and Code

The follow packages need to be installed for this sprint:

    OSMnx

    folium

To do this, use the following command at the Anaconda prompt (notice that folium is installed as part of the OSMnx installation):

    conda install -c conda-forge osmnx
    
**Note:** During this process, the following packages will also be installed:

    altair
    
    branca
    
    folium
    
    geographiclib
    
    geopy
    
    vincent


### Data Used in this Analysis

**Red Light Camera Data** â€“ List of red light cameras installed in the city of Toronto. This data can be found in The City of Toronto Open Data Catalogue. 

https://portal0.cf.opendata.inter.sandbox-toronto.ca/dataset/red-light-cameras/

**Red Light Accident Data** - This dataset is a subset of the Killed and Seriously Injured (KSI) dataset from 2008-2018. These events include any serious or fatal collision where red light running played a role in the collision. This dataset is collected by the Toronto Police Service and can be found on The Toronto Police Services Public Safety Data Portal.

http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/red-light/data

Both data files can be found in the data folder of this project.


### Methodology

We will be using the following methodology:

1. Interactive map visualisation of cameras geopoints alongside accidents geopoints using the folium package in Python. This will allow us to examine the red light cameras with respect to how the accidents are situated around them by drilling down to the intersection level.

2. Calculation of nearest accidents to each camera. We will calculate the distance (Euclidean) between each red light camera and each accident. The returned distance is based on the projection of the points (degrees in WGS84, meters in UTM). We will define a catchment area, which would ideally be decided by our client (in this case The City of Toronto). Accidents for each red light camera with distances that fall within this catchment area will be flagged and the details of these cameras and accidents printed for further review.
